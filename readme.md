# ASCIIFIER

The main script (image_printer_go_brrr.py, which I really should have changed before posting)
reads an image file into memory and parses it into colored text using ansi escapes,
then dumps it to stdout. I find this really fun, and sometimes even useful.

I hope to eventually evolve it into something that could be easily consumed
by other code, maybe being used in the context of something with a terminal
UI (curses, perhaps?). This might already be out there, I wouldn't know since
I don't know any curses - this is just a passion project!

It uses a handful of switches to provide highly configurable output.
Check out its output with the -h flag!

I've only tested this on Linux in gnome-terminal under X11, but I have had a friend
clone it and run it in powershell and cmd on Windows 11 with reasonable results.
Windows terminals don't seem to behave as well and there's some chop/screen tearing
going on when animated gifs are processed. I hope to resolve this soon but it takes a
lot (like real work) to get me to run Windows, to be fully honest. Regardless, here it
is working its magic on my Linux box:
