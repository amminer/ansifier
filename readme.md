# ASCIIFIER

I find this really fun, and sometimes even useful.

I hope to eventually evolve it into something that could be consumed
by other code, maybe being used in the context of something with a terminal
UI (curses, perhaps?). This might already be out there, I wouldn't know since
I don't know any curses - this is just a passion project!

It uses a handful of switches to provide highly configurable output.
Check out its output with the -h flag!

One of my favorite features is that it can handle animated .gifs:

I have ideas for more options, so keep an eye out for updates
and feel free to reach out to me if you have an idea and want to
link and build, fam :)

Some examples of its utility:

* Easily generate cute graphic images for notes you're taking:
