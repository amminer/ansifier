# ASCIIFIER

The main script (named image_printer_go_brrr.py, which I really should have changed before posting to github)
reads an image file into memory and parses it into colored text using ansi escapes,
then dumps it to stdout. I find this really fun, and sometimes even useful.

I hope to eventually evolve it into something that could be easily consumed
by other code, maybe being used in the context of something with a terminal
UI (curses, perhaps?). I also have at least one good idea for how I would
integrate this into a broader program of my own design.

It uses a handful of switches to provide highly configurable output when called
as the main module from the terminal. Check out the -h flag!

I've only tested this on Linux in gnome-terminal under X11 (works great) and on Windows 10
in msys2/git bash (works not so great), but I have had a friend
clone it and run it in powershell and cmd on Windows 11 with reasonable results.
None of the windows-based terminals I've seen it run on don't seem to behave as well with
animated gifs. I intend to resolve this before extending the core function of the image printer
script any further - see the issues tab on github.

Anyway, here it is in action!

I'm using a github-issues-first approach to manage work on this project - when you or I
notice that something is wrong or would like to see a feature implemented, ideally an
issue is created, and after any needed discussion that issue gets translated into a
ticket on the project's [kanban board](https://github.com/users/amminer/projects/1).

Once I'm satisfied with the state of the code and its functionality I will stop pushing
straight to main, I swear! Feature and bug branches coming soon. :)

## Some examples of the script's utility:
